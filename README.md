# ArcGIS JS API 4.4 / React / Redux Boilerplate

Web Scene viewer boilerplate web application using React and Redux, including the ArcGIS JS API
as middleware. This boilerplate example integrates:

* [ArcGIS JS API 4.4](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [React Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) (connect)
* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
* [Calcite Web](http://esri.github.io/calcite-web/)

It provides two useful Redux middleware examples:

* **arcgis-authentication** to handle Portal login
* **arcgis-sceneview** to show a SceneView with a WebScene, handle selection, and environment changes.

# Instructions

### Registering your App

For this code to work, you need to
[register an app](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/marketplace/provider/register-app.htm) in ArcGIS Online,
add the correct redirect URI (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`), and add the App ID to
`src/constants.js`.

* [How to register an app in ArcGIS Online](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/marketplace/provider/register-app.htm)
* Make sure to set the correct redirect URI (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`)

Finally, update `src/constants.js` to contain your App ID (and portal URL if not ArcGIS Online):

```javascript
export const APP_ID = '<insert App ID here>';
export const APP_PORTAL_URL = 'https://www.arcgis.com';

export default APP_ID;
```

### Installing

Download the repository and install the dependencies:

`npm install`

### Running

Run tests:

`npm test`

Run [ESLint](http://eslint.org/):

`gulp lint`

Build and run live server:

`gulp server`

# Development Workflow

The [ArcGIS JS API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) is based on
[Dojo](https://dojotoolkit.org/). To make this ES6 application work, we use
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to bundle it
into an AMD module. This AMD module is configured as the application (app) in `dojoConfig.js`.

This package uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for workflow automation.

# Redux Dev Tools

This package supports the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)
for Chrome. You can browse the state and dispatch actions live while the application is running.

# Hot Module Replacement

This example supports [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/).
Updates to components or reducers are automatically exchanged while the application is running.

Of course, this does not apply to changes to the ArcGIS middleware. Also, keep in mind that
because an ArcGIS web scene is connected to a DOM element, the web scene needs to be reloaded each
time the components are refreshed.

# Tests

This example includes [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) tests for:

* Action creators
* Reducers
* ArcGIS Middleware

And [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html) tests for:

* Components
